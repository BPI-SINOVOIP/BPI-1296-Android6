This is an enumeration for declaring code standard type variables. Currently,
different video standards such as HEVC, MPEG4 SP/ASP, H.263 Profile 3, AVC (H.264)
BP/MP/HP, HEVC (H.265), VC-1 SP/MP/AP, Divx3, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, AVS, RealVideo 8/9/10, AVS Jizhun/Guangdian profile,
 Theora, VP3 and VP8 decoders are supported by VPU.

NOTE: MPEG-1 decoder operation will be handled as a special case of MPEG-2 decoder.
STD_THO must be always 9. For WAVE4 product, only STD_HEVC should be declared.

This is a data structure for representing frame buffer pointers of each color
component and co-located motion vector buffer for B-frame processing. In case of CbCr interleave mode, Cb and Cr frame data are written to memory area started from bufCb address.

All of the 3 component addresses must be 8-byte aligned. One pixel value
of a component occupies one byte, and the frame data is in YCbCr 4:2:0 CodecCommandformat.
So the sizes of Cb and Cr buffer are 1/4 of Y buffer size. HOST application must
allocate external SDRAM spaces for those components by using this data
structure.

The last co-located motion vector is only required for B-frame decoding in
H.264/AVC MP/HP, MPEG-4 ASP, VC-1 MP/AP, AVS, RealVideo 8/9/10, etc.

    with specifying the start address, read pointer.

    Before decoding bitstream, HOST application must feed the decoder with bitstream. To
    do that, HOST application must know where to put bitstream and the maximum size.
    Applications can get the information by calling this function. This way is more
    efficient than providing arbitrary bitstream buffer to the decoder as far as
    VPU is concerned.

    The given size is the total sum of free space in ring buffer. So when
    a HOST application downloads this given size of bitstream, Wrptr could meet the end of
    stream buffer. In this case, the HOST application should wrap-around the Wrptr back to the
    beginning of stream buffer, and download the remaining bits. If not, decoder
    operation could be crashed.

    @* h.264
    @** 4 : user_data_registered_itu_t_t35
    @** 5 : user_data_unregistered

    More details are in Annex D of h.264 specifications.

    @* vc1
    @** 31 : Sequence Level user data
    @** 30 : Entry-point Level user data
    @** 29 : Frame Level user data
    @** 28 : Field Level user data
    @** 27 : Slice Level user data

    @* mp2
    @** 0 : Sequence user data
    @** 1 : GOP user data

    ====== GET_DRAM_CONFIG
    TBD



    ====== ENABLE_REP_BUFSTAT
    This command enables frame buffer status report. This command ignores pParam and
    returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

    If this option is enabled, frame buffer status is reported.
    Each frame buffers can be used for display, reference or not used. Decoder
    reports the status of each frame buffer by using 4 bits [3:0]

    @* [3] Not used
    @* [2] USE_DIS
    @* [1] USE_REF
    @* [0] Not used

    For example, if the value of frame buffer status is 6, then the frame buffer is
    used for reference and display. If 4, the frame buffer is used for display and
    is not used for reference.

    In H.264, bit field definition is as bellows:

    @* [3] Not used
    @* [2] USE_DIS
    @* [1] USE_OUT
    @* [0] USE_REF

    If USE_OUT is 1, it means that the Frame is in DPB buffer.

    returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

    ====== ENABLE_REP_MV
    This command enables MV report. This command ignores pParam and returns
    RETCODE_SUCCESS.

    If this option is enabled, decoder reports 1 motion vector for P picture and 2
    motion vectors for B picture.

    ====== DISABLE_REP_MV
    This command disables MV report. This command ignores pParam and returns
    RETCODE_SUCCESS.


    ====== SET_ADDR_REP_PICPARAM
    This command sets the address of picture parameter base. pParam is interpreted
    as a pointer to a address.

    This command has one of the following return codes.::

    * RETCODE_SUCCESS:
    Operation was done successfully, which means given value of address is valid and
    setting is done successfully.
    * RETCODE_INVALID_PARAM:
    The given argument parameter, pParam, was invalid, which means given value of
    address is invalid. The value of address must be greater than 0 and a multiple
    of 8.

    To report frame buffer status, MB parameter and Motion vector, VPU reads the base
    addresses of external memory, which are specified by PicParaBaseAddr.

    When `picUserDataEnable`, `mvReportEnable`, `mbParamEnable` or `frmBufStaEnable` in
    CMD_DEC_PIC_OPTION register are enabled, host should specify buffer addresses in
    <<dec_picparam_address_struct>>.
    VPU reports each data and fills info, Data Size and MV num fields to
     these buffer addresses of external memory. For VPU to report data
    properly, host needs to specify these 3 buffer addresses preserving 8 byte alignment
    and buffer sizes need to be multiples of 256.

    ====== DEC_GET_DISPLAY_OUTPUT_INFO
    HOST can get decoder output information according to display index in DecOutputInfo structure.
    HOST can set display index using member variable `indexFrameDisplay`.
    This command returns RETCODE_SUCCESS.

    * Example code
    .........................................................................
    DecOutputInfo decOutputInfo;
    decOutputInfo. indexFrameDisplay = disp_index;
    VPU_DecGiveCommand(handle, DEC_GET_DISPLAY_OUTPUT_INFO, & decOutputInfo);
    .........................................................................

    ====== DEC_SET_FRAME_DELAY
    HOST can set the number of frame to be delayed before display (H.264/AVC only) by using this command.
    This command is useful when display frame buffer delay is supposed to happen for buffering decoded picture reorder and
    HOST is sure of that.
    Unless this command is executed, VPU has display frame buffer delay as frameBufDelay value of DecInitialInfo structure.

    ====== DEC_FREE_FRAME_BUFFER
    HOST can free all the frame buffers allocated by VPUAPI.
    This command is useful when VPU detects sequence change.
    For example, if HOST knows resolution change while decoding through `sequenceChanged` variable of DecOutputInfo structure,
    HOST should change the size of frame buffer accordingly.
    This command is used to release the frame buffers allocated for the previous sequence.
    Then VPU_DecGetInitialInfo() and VPU_DecIsseuSeqInit() are called before frame buffer allocation for a new sequence.

    ====== DEC_SET_DISPLAY_FLAG
    Applications can set a display flag for each frame buffer by calling this function after creating
    decoder instance. If a certain display flag of frame buffer is set, the frame buffer cannot be used in the
    decoding process. Applications can control displaying a buffer with this command
    to prevent VPU from using buffer in every decoding process.

    This command is the opposite of what VPU_DecClrDispFlag() does.
    All of buffer flags are initialized with 0x00000000 which means being able to decode.
    Unless it is called, VPU starts decoding with available frame buffer that has been cleared
    in round robin order.

    ====== DEC_GET_SEQ_INFO
    This command returns the information of a current sequence in the form of DecInitialInfo structure.
    HOST can get this information with more accuracy after VPU_DecIssueSeqInit() or VPU_DecGetOutputInfo() is called.


    ====== ENABLE_LOGGING
    HOST can activate message logging once VPU_DecOpen() or VPU_EncOpen() is called.

    ====== DISABLE_LOGGING
    HOST can deactivate message logging which is off as default.

    ====== DEC_SET_2ND_FIELD_INFO
    This command sets bistream buffer information for a second field after a first field has been decoded.
    In case of AVC, MPEG2, or VC1 decoder, they issue an INT_BIT_DEC_FIELD interrupt after first field decoding.
    This command then can give VPU the address and size of bitstream buffer for a second field.
    This commands is used when first field and second field are in separate bistreams - not together in a bitstream.
    If HOST gives this command and clears the INT_BIT_DEC_FIELD interrupt,
    VPU starts decoding from the given base address until the size of bitstream buffer.


    ====== DEC_GET_FIELD_PIC_TYPE
    This command gets a field picture type of decoded picture after INT_BIT_DEC_FIELD interrupt is issued.


    ====== DEC_ENABLE_REORDER
    HOST can enable display buffer reordering when decoding H.264 streams. In H.264 case
    output decoded picture may be re-ordered if pic_order_cnt_type is 0 or 1. In that case, decoder
    must delay output display for re-ordering but some applications (ex. video telephony) do not
    want such display delay.

    ====== DEC_DISABLE_REORDER
    HOST can disable output display buffer reorder-ing. Then BIT processor does not re-order output buffer when pic_order_cnt_type is 0 or 1. If
    In H.264 case. pic_order_cnt_type is 2 or the other standard case, this flag is ignored because output display
    buffer reordering is not allowed.

    ====== DEC_GET_FRAMEBUF_INFO
    This command gives HOST the information of framebuffer in the form of DecGetFramebufInfo structure.

    ====== DEC_RESET_FRAMEBUF_INFO
    This command resets the information of framebuffer.
    Unlike DEC_FREE_FRAME_BUFFER, it does not release the assigned memory itself.
    This command is used for sequence change along with DEC_GET_FRAMEBUF_INFO.
