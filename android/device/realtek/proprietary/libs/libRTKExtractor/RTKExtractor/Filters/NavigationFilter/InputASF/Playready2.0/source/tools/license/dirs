# This file is read by both the NTBUILD tool and the Porting Kit's makefile
# system. The latter requires the order of directories to be:
#     1st - Directories that build headers
#     2nd - Directories that build objects
#     3rd - Directories that build libraries
#     4th - Directories that build executables and DLLs
# This is analagous to the PASS0, PASS1a/1b, and PASS2 phases of NTBUILD.
#
# If one lib packages up another, the final lib must appear later in the list.
#
# DIRS is read by NTBUILD and the Porting Kit if DRM_DIRS isn't present.
#
# DRM_DIRS is the optional override for use by the Porting Kit. Directory
# selection can be restricted by platform, architecture, or a combo as follows:
# DRM_DIRS=foo{ARM} bar{ANSI} baz{ANSI_X86}
#
# Supported tags (out of the box):
# - Platform: ANSI
# - Architecture: X86, AMD64/X64, ARM
# - PlatArch: Platform and Arch separated by an underscore (e.g. ANSI_X86)
