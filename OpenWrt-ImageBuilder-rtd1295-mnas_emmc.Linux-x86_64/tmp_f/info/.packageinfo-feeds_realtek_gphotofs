Title: GPhotoFS is a filesystem client based on libgphoto2 
Maintainer:

Type: ipkg

Description:  	GPhotoFS is a filesystem client based on libgphoto2 that exposes
       supported cameras as filesystems; while some cameras implement the USB
       Mass Storage class and already appear as filesystems (making this
       program redundant), many use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) or
       some other custom protocol. But as long as the camera is supported by
       libgphoto2, it can be mounted as a filesystem using this program.

       As libgphoto2 is a userspace library for interacting with cameras, it
       is natural that if one to build a filesystem ontop of it, one should
       use FUSE, and that is what I have done.
