Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf)
 implementation (library). It facilitates
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with,
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 The libavahi package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries,
 used by other programs. Specifically, it provides
 libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 .
 The libavahi-dbus-support package enables
 D-Bus support in avahi, needed to support
 the libavahi-client library and avahi-utils.
 .
 Selecting this package modifies the build configuration
 so that avahi packages are built with support for D-BUS enabled;
 it does not generate a separate binary of its own.
 It also automatically adds the D-Bus package to the build.
 libavahi-dbus-support is selected automatically if you select
 libavahi-client or avahi-utils.
